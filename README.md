# Spotify Content Viewer

This is a web application that consumes the Spotify API and displays the user's top played artists/songs as downloadable 9x9 image grids and their top genres in a visual dashboard.

My main goal working on this was to get more acquainted with API integration/consumption and to combine it with the stylization/layout skills I have sought to develop over the past couple of months. It was also a great opportunity for me to get in touch with new libraries - primarily <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image">html-to-image</a> and <a href="https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/victory/">Victory</a>, which I used for making the downloadable image grids and the graphs in the visual dashboard respectively.
